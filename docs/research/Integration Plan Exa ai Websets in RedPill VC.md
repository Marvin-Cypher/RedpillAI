# Integration Plan: Exa.ai Websets in RedPill VC

Status: Not started

## Current RedPill VC Features & Data Sources

RedPill VC currently enriches company data using third-party APIs and custom parsing. Specifically, the platform uses **Tavily API** for real-time company intelligence – gathering company profiles, team info, funding history, news, etc. – and **OpenBB** for financial market data. For example, when a new company is added to the system, the backend calls Tavily to fetch the company’s profile and related info, then OpenBB for stock/crypto metrics. This data is then merged into the company’s record in the database.

*Tavily* searches the web (targeting sources like Crunchbase, PitchBook, LinkedIn, etc.) to return results and an AI-generated “answer,” after which RedPill’s code parses text for specific facts (founding year, headquarters, team size, etc.). This approach works but relies on regex extraction and is limited by Tavily’s search capabilities. There is currently no feature for users to perform arbitrary AI-driven searches – they can only search companies by name or filter by attributes already in the database.

## Why Exa.ai Websets?

**Exa.ai’s Websets API** offers a more powerful, AI-driven solution to meet and exceed these needs. Websets are essentially *search containers* managed by AI agents that can find, verify, and structure web data at scale. Instead of simple one-off queries, a Webset can perform complex multi-criteria searches, store structured results (called *Webset Items*), and even keep updating them over time. Key advantages of integrating Exa Websets include:

- **Complex Query Capability:** Websets enable extremely nuanced searches that conventional search engines or our current system struggle with. For example, queries like *“startups in NYC with more than 10 employees working on futuristic hardware”* or *“find software engineers in the Bay Area who have a blog”* are precisely the kind of complex requests Websets were built to handle. This means RedPill users could search for companies or founders based on any combination of criteria (location, team size, tech focus, etc.) and get accurate, AI-filtered results – a huge value-add over simple name or keyword search.
- **Structured & Verified Results:** Each Webset result comes with structured fields and verification info. Exa’s agents don’t just return links; they classify the entity (company, person, article, etc.), provide relevant details, and evaluate whether the result meets the search criteria. For instance, a Webset searching for **companies** can return each company’s name, description, and other attributes in a structured format (rather than raw text), along with a “satisfied” flag for each criterion and references explaining why that result was included. This will reduce our reliance on fragile regex parsing – the data will be cleaner and ready to use.
- **Depth of Search:** Exa’s search is far more exhaustive. In internal benchmarks, *Exa Websets retrieved over 20× more correct results than Google for complex queries*. Websets can retrieve *hundreds* of relevant results if needed (the system can go well beyond Google’s 100 result limit by using more compute). This means our users can discover a much broader set of companies or news articles matching their query, rather than being limited to a handful of results. It’s like having an AI research analyst comb through the entire web for you.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Perhaps one of the most exciting features is Exa’s **Monitors**, which allow automatic scheduled updates to a Webset. In practice, this means we can *keep data fresh* without manual intervention. For example, we can set up a Webset to track news about startup funding, with a monitor that runs daily. The monitor will perform the search (e.g. “startup funding round announcements in the last 24 hours”) and automatically append new items to the Webset. Exa handles deduplicating repeat stories and can even send real-time webhook events when new items are found. This capability will let RedPill provide up-to-date news and market intelligence on companies or sectors **continuously**, which currently isn’t possible with our one-off Tavily queries.
- **Versatility (Companies, People, Domains, etc.):** Exa is not limited to company info. It can search for **people** (e.g. founders, key executives) by treating them as entities, find **news articles** or research papers, and even crawl specific **domains**. For instance, Exa can be instructed to find all pages on a company’s domain related to a certain topic, or we can supply a domain as a search scope to gather intelligence about a competitor. Websets provide an Imports feature to ingest specific URLs or domains, and the search can also be constrained to a given domain. This means if a user inputs a company’s website, we could initiate a crawl (via Exa or integrated tools) to fetch important information from that site (e.g. team page, product pages, etc.), all within the Webset framework.

In short, integrating Exa.ai will transform RedPill VC’s data capabilities – from **richer company profiles** to **AI-driven discovery** of new opportunities, and **real-time tracking** of news – making these features a core “aha moment” for our users.

## Integration Strategy Overview

We plan to integrate Exa Websets step-by-step into the RedPill VC backend and frontend, replacing Tavily for company intelligence and adding new AI-powered features. The major components of this plan include:

1. **Exa API Setup and Configuration**
    
    We will add the Exa API credentials to our configuration and instantiate an Exa client in the backend (using the official `exa_py` SDK or direct REST calls). Similar to how we configured Tavily (with an API key in settings), we’ll introduce an `EXA_API_KEY` and a new `ExaService` service class. This service will handle communication with Exa’s API (search queries, retrieving results, setting up monitors, etc.). Proper initialization and error handling will be implemented (e.g. logging if the key is missing or invalid, similar to TavilyService’s startup log).
    
2. **Replacing Tavily for Company Data Enrichment**
    
    All places where we currently call Tavily will be updated to use Exa. The primary area is the **CompanyEnrichmentService**, which on enrichment calls `TavilyService.fetch_company_profile/funding/team/news` in sequence. We will replace these with ExaService equivalents:
    
    - **Company Profile & Overview:** Instead of `TavilyService.fetch_company_profile`, we’ll call an Exa Webset search focusing on the company. For example, we can create a Webset with a search query like `"<Company Name> company profile overview"`, and specify `entity: {"type": "company"}` to hint we’re looking for a company. We may also include criteria or domain filters (e.g. expecting results from Crunchbase, official site, etc.) to hone accuracy. Once Exa returns results (which it will do asynchronously), we’ll retrieve the top structured item(s) from the Webset. This should give us fields like the company’s URL, a description, etc., which we can use directly or parse further if needed. Additionally, Exa can produce an **“answer” summary** with citations for the query if we use its Q&A mode – this could directly serve as a company description. If available, we will use the answer text as the description and rely less on our regex extraction. (Our current code gave priority to Tavily’s answer snippet for the description; Exa’s answer would be analogous, likely more robust).
    - **Funding History & Investors:** We will perform a targeted Exa search for funding data, similar to our Tavily approach. For example, query `"<Company Name> funding history investors Series A B C seed"` with `entity: {"type": "article"}` or `{"type": "company"}` (depending on what yields better info), possibly limiting to known sources (TechCrunch, Crunchbase news, etc.). Exa’s strength in semantic search may surface a Crunchbase entry or news articles about funding rounds. We can also add a criterion like *“mentions funding rounds or investment”* to ensure relevance. The results (and any AI answer) will be processed to extract total funding, recent rounds, and key investors. We might still apply some parsing on the returned text (e.g. looking for “Series A” or “$XX million”) but expect Exa’s results to be cleaner. Over time, we could create an **enrichment agent** in Exa that directly answers “List the funding rounds of ” to get structured output (leveraging Exa’s enrichment step to extract data points).
    - **Team & Founders:** Similar to above, use Exa to find leadership information. Query like `"<Company Name> founders CEO CTO team"` with entity type person or company, focusing on LinkedIn, Crunchbase, etc. Since Exa can return *people* items, one approach is to let it return person-type results (e.g. the CEO’s profile as a WebsetItem with name and title). This would directly give us founder names and positions without scraping. In addition, we can ask Exa’s enrichment to list key people if not directly present. Our current Tavily integration scraped these details via content text search; Exa’s structured approach could simplify this.
    - **Recent News & Market Intelligence:** We will use Exa for news monitoring about the company. Rather than a one-time “news” query at enrichment time only, we can leverage Exa Monitors (discussed below) for continuous updates. However, even at initial enrichment, Exa can perform an “advanced” search for recent news articles mentioning the company. We’ll create a search query like `"<Company Name> recent news 2024 2025 <Industry>"` and possibly add criteria such as *“Article is about ”*. Exa will return relevant news items with timestamps and sources. We can store a few of these headlines in the company’s profile (for example, attach the latest 3 news article titles, links, and dates to show in the UI). This is akin to what Tavily provided, but Exa can likely find more and higher-quality news (with the ability to filter out irrelevant or low-quality sources automatically).
    
    In implementing these, we will make **minimal changes to the data model** – the `Company.enriched_data` JSON field can now hold Exa’s structured response instead of Tavily’s. We’ll ensure backward compatibility by keeping field names consistent (e.g., we will fill `founded_year`, `headquarters`, etc. in the enriched_data so the frontend displays correctly). Testing will be done to confirm that replacing Tavily with Exa yields equal or better data for a variety of companies (startups, crypto projects, etc.). Once proven, TavilyService can be deprecated.
    
3. **AI-Powered Search for Companies & Founders (General Search)**
    
    We will introduce a **new feature allowing users to search for companies or people based on arbitrary input**, turning Exa’s capabilities into a core user-facing tool. Make Search Bar as the entry default page of redpill VC.
    
    This could be exposed as a “Discovery” search bar in the UI or an API endpoint like `/search`. Key aspects of this feature:
    
    - Users can enter natural language queries describing what they’re looking for. For example: *“Fintech startups in Europe founded after 2018”*, or *“Female founders in AI who have exited a company”*. This is where Exa Websets shines, by interpreting the query and retrieving entities that match the conditions.
    - In the backend, we will create a new Webset for the query. We will set `entity.type` based on the context: if the query seems to target companies (contains words like *startup, company, fundraise*, etc.), we use `type: "company"`; if it mentions individuals (e.g. *engineers, founders, CEO*), we use `type: "person"`. We can also expose a toggle in the UI (search companies vs search people). The query and any criteria (if the user provided structured filters in a form UI) will be passed to Exa. **Example:** For the query *“fintech startups in Europe founded after 2018”*, we would send:
        
        ```json
        {
          "search": {
            "query": "Fintech startups in Europe founded after 2018",
            "entity": { "type": "company" },
            "count": 50,
            "criteria": [
               {"description": "Company was founded after 2018"}
            ]
          }
        }
        
        ```
        
        Exa’s agents will interpret this and likely use heuristics to find fintech companies, then verify founding year > 2018 for each. The results come back as a list of structured *WebsetItems* with type=company, including name, URL, description, etc., and each item’s evaluations telling us if the criteria were met.
        
    - We will retrieve these results (using the `list items` API once the search is completed or streaming them as they arrive). The backend will format the results into a response for the frontend. Each result could include the company name, a short description or industry, maybe the website, and importantly *why it matched* (Exa can provide reasoning and references for each item). We can display a snippet like “✅ Founded in 2019, London, UK” to give the user confidence that the result meets the query.
    - For **founder/person searches**, the process is similar but we use `entity.type: "person"`. Exa can return person items with fields like name, position, associated company, location, etc.. For instance, a query *“founders in AI who raised Series B funding”* might return a list of entrepreneurs, each with their name, their company (as a nested field), and maybe a link to a profile or news about them. This effectively gives us a **semantic people search**, powered by Exa’s web knowledge (e.g., scanning articles, LinkedIn, etc.).
    - We will incorporate this feature into the UI as a marquee capability. This fulfills the user’s request to **“search companies/VCs based on any input”** and **“search founders”** using AI. It will be branded as a core feature – for example, “RedPill Discovery (beta) – Powered by AI”. The UI may allow refining results or saving them. We will also highlight that results come with source citations (something our users can trust as due diligence references).
    - **Performance considerations:** Because Webset searches are asynchronous and can take a few seconds (especially if we request 50+ results), we will implement the frontend to show a loading indicator and possibly partial results streaming. Exa emits events as items are found, so we can poll the API or use a websocket to progressively show results. In case a query is extremely broad and yields hundreds of items, we might cap the results or allow pagination (Exa’s API supports pagination via cursors).
    
    This feature not only provides an *“aha” moment* to users, but also positions RedPill VC as a smarter platform. Instead of manually browsing databases, users can let the AI find the needles in the haystack – for example, discovering an unknown startup that fits their thesis, or identifying all founders in a niche sector. This will be a key selling point, so our plan includes marketing it prominently once implemented.
    
4. **News Tracking and Alerts with Webset Monitors**
    
    To keep users informed of new developments, we will leverage Exa’s *monitor* capability for continuous updates. The idea is to **keep tracking news** on companies or topics automatically. Our integration plan for monitors includes:
    
    - **Automated Company News Monitors:** For each company in our database (or at least those marked as “in pipeline” or “portfolio”), we can create a Webset monitor that tracks news about that company. The monitor would run a search query like *“ news”* on a daily schedule. Because Exa monitors can use the last search’s query with relative date filters, we can have it continuously pull *new* articles. For example, when setting up the Webset for company XYZ, the search could include a criterion “Article was published in the last 7 days” and we set the monitor to run weekly. Each run, Exa will find any new articles in that timeframe. New findings trigger `webset.item.created` events, which we can catch via webhook or poll. We will build a background worker (or use FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks) to listen for these events or regularly fetch new items, and then store the news in our database (e.g., in a `company_news` table or JSON field).
    - **Topic Monitors (VC & Funding News):** In addition to company-specific news, we can create monitors for broader VC-related news that might interest all users. For instance, a Webset monitor for *“startup funding round announcements”* as shown in Exa’s demo. This monitor could aggregate daily funding news (perhaps focusing on certain domains like TechCrunch, VentureBeat as criteria). We can surface these in a “News” section of our app – effectively an AI-curated news feed. Because Exa can de-duplicate stories and filter sources, the feed will be high-quality. We could also allow users to customize which monitors they subscribe to (e.g., follow sectors or keywords).
    - **Founder/Person Monitors:** Similarly, if a user is tracking a particular person (say a notable founder or an investor), we could set up a monitor for news about that person (e.g., “ interviews OR news”). This is an extension for later, but uses the same mechanism.
    - **Integration details:** We will utilize Exa’s webhook system to avoid constant polling. Exa can send a webhook to our endpoint whenever new items are added or enriched. We’ll set up a secure webhook receiver in our backend (with signature verification as recommended). On receiving an event, we update the relevant company’s news in our DB and optionally notify users (if we build an alerts/notification feature). We might not notify for every item by default, but the data will be there when the user views the company or the news page.
    - **UI/UX:** Companies in the UI can have a “News” section that is automatically populated with the latest articles found. We can display the headline, source, and date – all of which Exa provides. For example: *“TechCrunch – Startup XYZ raises $5M Seed Round (Jan 5, 2025)”*. Since Exa also allows enrichment on items, we could even have it summarize the article into one sentence, which we could show on hover or underneath the headline. This gives busy VC investors a quick briefing on the news without leaving our app.
    - **Deduplication and Quality:** We will rely on Exa’s built-in features to avoid duplicate news (it clusters similar articles) and exclude junk sources. This saves us implementation effort on cleaning the feed.

By implementing monitors, RedPill VC transitions from static data to a living, breathing intelligence platform. Users will **always see up-to-date information** on the companies they care about, which encourages them to rely on our app daily. This continuous updating (with zero manual labor on our side) is a direct benefit of Exa integration and a compelling selling point: *“Stay informed on autopilot – RedPill’s AI monitors the news for you.”*

1. **Domain-Specific Intelligence (Webset for Single Domain)**
    
    We also want to allow fetching information based on a single domain input – for example, a user enters a competitor’s website URL and wants to get all relevant insights about that company. Exa can assist here in a couple of ways:
    
    - **Targeted Site Search:** We can create a Webset that focuses on a specific domain. Using Exa’s `include_domains` parameter or a site-specific query, we can ask for pages on that domain. For instance, if the domain is *examplecorp.com*, we might run a search for `"site:examplecorp.com team investors news"` or simply use Exa’s ability to crawl the site. Exa’s *search agents* will find subpages (like “About Us”, press releases, blog posts on that site) that match those keywords. The resulting WebsetItems will have the page URLs and content snippets. We could then apply an **enrichment** to summarize each page. For example, instruct Exa: *“Summarize the key points of this page”* – which could yield a quick blurb about the team from the About page, etc.
    - **Automated Site Crawl (Advanced):** Exa’s API allows importing a list of URLs or connecting a crawler. In the future, we might use an **Import** to feed the company’s homepage URL and let Exa discover links (similar to how our existing Firecrawl might work). However, this may be beyond the immediate scope. Initially, leveraging Exa’s search index for that domain is faster and cost-efficient.
    - **Use Case Integration:** This feature can be presented as *“Competitive Analysis: enter a company website and get a full briefing.”* Once the Webset is created and items fetched, we can compile a report for the user. For example, if the domain’s pages yielded: team page, product page, recent blog article – we can display the structured info (like number of team members if found, product descriptions, etc.). We might even run a Q&A enrichment like *“What does this company do and who are its founders?”* across the crawled content. Exa’s answer would give a concise overview with citations to the company’s site or news. This effectively replaces the manual task of scouring a website and Googling the company – the AI does it in one go.
    - We will need to consider the cost of a deep crawl; as such, we might limit this to perhaps the top 5-10 pages from the domain unless the user has a high credit balance (discussed next).

Incorporating domain-based webset searches further **leverages Exa’s web crawling power** and rounds out our data coverage – even if a company isn’t famous enough to be in Crunchbase, as long as they have a website or web presence, Exa can pull in information about them.

1. **Cost Management & Credit System**
    
    Integrating Exa’s API will incur usage costs (Exa likely charges per search, per number of results, and per monitor run). To ensure this is sustainable, we will implement a **credit-based billing system** in RedPill VC. The goal is to pass the Exa usage cost to the end user in a fair and transparent way.
    
    - **Define Credit Pricing:** We will map Exa operations to “credits”. For instance, one simple web search might cost 1 credit, a more intensive Webset (with 50 results or with content enrichment) maybe 2–3 credits, and a monitor that runs daily might cost a certain number of credits per month. We will refer to Exa’s pricing documentation to calibrate this. Our internal notes on Tavily show an estimate of cost per search (e.g. Tavily basic search ~$0.005); we can use similar figures for Exa or adjust as needed for their pricing. These credit costs will be baked into our product pricing model (e.g. users on higher-tier plans get more credits included).
    - **Usage Tracking:** In the backend, every time an ExaService call is made (search or monitor run), we will deduct the appropriate number of credits from the user’s account. We’ll extend our user model to have a `credits` balance. For example, if a user performs a “Discovery search” query, we subtract X credits. If a monitor is set up for a company, we might reserve some credits for its future runs or deduct per run. We will also implement safeguards: if a user has no credits, certain heavy features will be disabled or prompt an upgrade.
    - **Purchasing & Notifications:** We plan to add a UI for users to buy more credits or upgrade their subscription. This could simply link to our billing page where they can purchase credit packs. Additionally, the app should alert users when a feature will consume credits (“This AI search will use 2 credits”) and when their credit balance is low.
    - **Cost Monitoring:** On our side, we will monitor the actual Exa charges to ensure our credit system maps properly. We will log Exa usage events with cost info (Exa’s API responses include request IDs; we might correlate those with our operations). The system will be designed to scale: if a user does a very broad search (say 1000 results), we’ll either throttle it or charge accordingly so that we aren’t caught by surprise costs. We might also implement **query limits** (e.g., max 50 results for standard users) to manage cost.

By introducing credits, we align usage with cost: power users who utilize a lot of AI searches will pay more, while casual users can stick to included credits. This model was explicitly desired and ensures that integrating Exa’s powerful capabilities remains financially viable for us.

1. **Implementation Phases & Timeline**
    
    To execute this integration thoroughly, we propose the following phases:
    
    - **Phase 1: Backend Integration of Exa (Core Data)** – Focus on replacing Tavily in the backend. Develop the ExaService with methods for company profile, funding, team, and a generic search method. Test these against a sample of companies to fine-tune queries and parsing. By end of this phase, the `enrich_company_data` flow should work via Exa (behind the scenes) and yield comparable or better data than before. We’ll keep Tavily calls as a fallback toggle during testing, but aim to remove them after validation.
    - **Phase 2: New Search & Monitor Features** – Implement the AI Discovery search endpoints and the monitors. This includes creating API routes for search queries (if needed) and building the monitor setup logic. Also, design and migrate any database structures needed for storing results or news items (e.g., a new model for News items linked to companies). Start with one or two monitors (like general funding news and maybe monitors for a small set of companies) to validate the flow (including webhook reception and handling). The front-end team can begin working in parallel on the UI for the search results and news feed.
    - **Phase 3: Frontend Integration & UX Polishing** – Integrate the new features into the UI. For search, create a results page or modal that displays Exa results elegantly (with filters, source links, etc.). For news, update the company detail page to show a list of news articles (and optionally a site-wide “News” page for general monitors). We will also incorporate visual cues that this is AI-powered (to emphasize the value). Gather feedback from internal users or a beta group on the relevance of results and adjust queries/criteria as needed.
    - **Phase 4: Credit System Rollout** – Implement the credit tracking in backend and add UI elements for showing balances and purchasing. This includes updating our Stripe (or billing provider) integration for handling credit purchases if not already in place. We’ll test that overuse of features correctly blocks or warns the user.
    - **Phase 5: Testing & Launch** – Rigorous testing of the entire flow in a staging environment. We will test various scenarios: enriching a new company, running a complex search query, seeing the credit deduction, monitor adding news after a day, etc. Any bugs (like missing data fields, race conditions with async tasks, or mis-counted credits) will be fixed. Finally, we plan a staged release: perhaps enable the new search feature to a subset of users first, then full rollout. Documentation and training materials will be prepared to help users understand and get excited about the new capabilities.

Throughout these phases, we will maintain clear communication about the new features being “powered by Exa.ai.” The integration will be done such that it’s modular – for example, if Exa has downtime or we hit an API limit, we can fail gracefully (maybe fallback to a basic search or show a message to retry). We’ll also continue to monitor data quality; if any specific data point is lacking via Exa (for instance, maybe employee count isn’t easily found), we might supplement it with another source or an OpenAI inference.

1. **Leveraging Exa Integration as a Selling Point**
    
    Once fully implemented, the fusion of Exa.ai’s capabilities into RedPill VC will be marketed as a core differentiator of our platform. A few ways we’ll leverage this:
    
    - **Highlight “AI-Powered Insights”:** We will prominently feature that our search and data enrichment is backed by a cutting-edge AI search engine (Exa). For example, on our landing page or pitch deck: *“Powered by Exa – the AI search engine built for deep web research”*. This association adds credibility (Exa’s tech is known for its prowess in the AI community) and assures users that RedPill has capabilities beyond a typical VC database.
    - **Aha Moments in Demo:** During product demos, we can show a live example of the AI search: e.g., type a complex query and watch how RedPill returns a rich list of companies with details, far beyond what one could find via Google or manual research. This will create a wow factor and clearly demonstrate the *value* – saving analysts hours of work by surfacing hidden gems automatically. As the Exa team noted, Websets can find results that Google can’t, thanks to an “army of agents” doing the legwork. We are effectively handing that army of AI agents to our users.
    - **Continuous Intelligence:** We will emphasize that RedPill is not just a static data source but a continuously updating intelligence system. The fact that news and information are refreshed daily (via monitors) means users can trust that they won’t miss critical updates. This addresses a pain point where analysts have to set up Google Alerts or manually check news – instead, our platform does it for them. It’s like having an AI research assistant working 24/7.
    - **Replacing Expensive Data Feeds:** Internally, our evaluation showed that Exa (and previously Tavily) could be viable alternatives to costly platforms like Crunchbase or PitchBook for many use cases. We will message to customers that RedPill provides *“Crunchbase-like data plus much more, without needing separate subscriptions.”* By integrating Exa, we aggregate information from across the web (Crunchbase, LinkedIn, news sites, etc.) and present it in one place. This can justify our pricing and attract users who are looking to reduce their tool stack. Essentially, we turn free web data into value through AI, and we can pass some of those savings to users (while still charging for credits, it may be more cost-efficient than legacy data sources).
    - **Scalability & Future-Proofing:** Finally, we’ll note that our platform is built on a scalable AI infrastructure. As Exa adds more features (like better PDF parsing, more data categories, etc.), RedPill can quickly leverage them. This keeps our product on the cutting edge without heavy R&D on our part – a strong selling point for investors and users alike.

## Conclusion

Integrating Exa.ai Websets into RedPill VC will **unlock a suite of powerful AI-driven features** that elevate the platform from a standard CRM/database to an intelligent assistant for venture investors. We will fully implement all the mentioned capabilities – comprehensive company data via Exa (replacing Tavily), AI discovery search for companies and founders, automated news tracking, and domain-specific insights – and make them core to the user experience (not just optional add-ons). There are no major blockers foreseen: we have access to Exa’s well-documented API and even example code to guide us. The main considerations will be managing async operations and costs, both of which we address through careful design (webhooks, credit system).

By shifting to Exa, RedPill VC gains a significant competitive edge. The integration plan above ensures we **leverage the full power of Exa** while smoothly merging it into our existing architecture and business model. Once executed, this will deliver the “aha moments” we want for our users – for example, finding that one perfect investment opportunity through an AI query or getting instant intel on a new trend – all within RedPill. This is aligned with our vision of making RedPill VC an indispensable, intelligence-driven platform for venture capital research and decision-making.

Overall, this plan enables us to **fully harness Exa.ai** in RedPill VC and position these AI capabilities as a marquee feature and key selling point of our product. We will proceed with implementing all of the above, ensuring that the cost is accounted for via user credits, and maintain other data integrations (like OpenBB for market data) for a well-rounded offering. The result will be a cutting-edge platform that delights users and stands out in the market for its AI-powered data prowess.
